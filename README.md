# Pong-Clone

Initially building from what I learnt with Axe-Game (Project 1 of GameDev.tv's C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners), but then taking what I learnt further into the course, I've created this clone of Pong.

Left Player uses W & S to move paddle up and down, and Right Player uses the Up & Down arrow keys.
